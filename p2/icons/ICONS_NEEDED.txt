ICON FILES NEEDED
=================

Please create the following icon files for the extension to display properly:

Required icons:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Icon Design Suggestions:
- Use UW-Madison colors (red: #c5050c, white)
- Include a book or graduation cap symbol
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

Quick Ways to Create Icons:
1. Use Canva (free): https://www.canva.com/
2. Use Figma (free): https://www.figma.com/
3. Use GIMP (free desktop app)
4. Use online icon generators
5. Convert existing images using online tools

Tips:
- Make sure icons are PNG format
- Use transparent backgrounds
- Keep designs simple for clarity at small sizes
- Test how they look in Chrome's toolbar

The extension will still work without icons, but will show a default placeholder.
